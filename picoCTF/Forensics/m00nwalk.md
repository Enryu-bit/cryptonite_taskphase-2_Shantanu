when i listened to the audio file. it didn't give me much of a hint. Then when i looked at the hint of how images were sent from the space i got to know about [SSTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television).<br>
To use SSTV i used this [link](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/956/how-to-convert-decode-a-slow-scan-television-transmissions-sstv-audio-file-to-images-using-qsstv-in-ubuntu-18-04).<br>
